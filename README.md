## ðŸ§® DAX Measures Used

A number of DAX measures were used to drive the KPIs and visuals across the report. Below are some key examples:

-- Total Revenue
`Total Revenue = SUM('Order Items'[payment_value])`

-- Avg Delivery Time (Days)
`Avg Delivery Time (Days) = 
    AVERAGEX(orders, DATEDIFF(orders[order_purchase_date], orders[order_delivered_date], DAY))`

-- Review Sentiment Classification
`Review_Sentiment = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        'order_reviews'[review_score] >= 4, "Positive",
        'order_reviews'[review_score] = 3, "Neutral",
        'order_reviews'[review_score] < 3, "Negative",
        "Unknown"
    )`

-- Total Product Sold
`Total Product Sold = COUNTROWS(order_items)`
